# Hex Colour Clock
A simple OS X clock application that shows the time formatted as an HTML colour code with that colour as the background colour.

Idea from [hex clock](http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/) by Jacopo Col√≤ ([@jacopocolo](twiter.com/jacopocolo)).

This is my first Swift application, put together in about an hour. No warranty is given or implied. The source code is released under the MIT license.
